# Simon Haglund

Hello :^)
I'm a 21 year old programmer/game developer from Sweden. Currently studying at FutureGames as a Game Programmer.

## Some stuff about me
I started programming at first in high school at LBS Bor√•s. Here I learnt how to work with C# and how to use Visual Studio and Unity. We also had game projects were we made games together with artists in groups once a year under a few weeks. Working like this was very fun and something I wanted to continue in so I applied to FutureGames as a Programmer, which is where I am currently. Here I have learned several things like another programming language C++ and also worked with Unreal Engine. I much prefer working in C# and Unity since I have more experience with it and am just better at it but C++ and Unreal Engine have their benefits so I am interested in learning more about it when I can. Not saying I don't want to learn more C# I really do of course.
