Hello :^)
I'm a 21 year old programmer/game developer from Sweden. Currently studying at FutureGames as a Game Programmer.

## Some stuff about me :)
I started programming at first in high school at LBS Bor√•s. Here I learnt how to work with C# and how to use Visual Studio and Unity. We also had game projects were we made games together with artists in groups once a year under a few weeks. Working like this was very fun and something I wanted to continue in so I applied to FutureGames as a Programmer, which is where I am currently. Here I have learned several things like another programming language C++ and also worked with Unreal Engine. I much prefer working in C# and Unity since I have more experience with it and am just better at it but C++ and Unreal Engine have their benefits so I am interested in learning more about it when I can. Not saying I don't want to learn more C# I really do of course. Anyway here is some stuff I've worked on:

## C# and Unity
My first three game projects where projects I worked in groups during high school. The first one was a simple 2D platformer where I worked on a few simple power-ups. The second was a 3D platform puzzle game where you went room to room solving puzzles. In this project I worked on most stuff in the game, like the player, objects, menus and transitioning between the rooms. The next one was a 2D platform fighter. I did most stuff within the game this time as well because we were only two programmers and I took on most of the work. Since I'm a smash player the game was very similar to smash haha. But it was very fun to make. 


## C++ and Unreal
