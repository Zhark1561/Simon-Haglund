Hello :^)
I'm a 21 year old programmer/game developer from Sweden. Currently studying at FutureGames as a Game Programmer.

## Some stuff about me :)
I started programming at first in high school at LBS Bor√•s. Here I learnt how to work with C# and how to use Visual Studio and Unity. We also had game projects were we made games together with artists in groups once a year under a few weeks. Working like this was very fun and something I wanted to continue in so I applied to FutureGames as a Programmer, which is where I am currently. Here I have learned several things like another programming language C++ and also worked with Unreal Engine. I much prefer working in C# and Unity since I have more experience with it and am just better at it but C++ and Unreal Engine have their benefits so I am interested in learning more about it when I can. Not saying I don't want to learn more C# I really do of course. Anyway here is some stuff I've worked on:

## C# and Unity
My first three game projects where projects I worked in groups during high school. The first one was a simple 2D platformer where I worked on a few simple power-ups. The second was a 3D platform puzzle game where you went room to room solving puzzles. In this project I worked on most stuff in the game, like the player, objects, menus and transitioning between the rooms. The next one was a 2D platform fighter called Fisticuffs Arena. I did most stuff within the game this time as well because we were only two programmers and I took on most of the work. So in the game you play as knights trying to knock each other out of the stage. You only have one attack which is just poking them with a sword which still made for fun gameplay but we were supposed to have actual attacks but didn't have time to make the animations. It wasn't that good of a game but it was fun enough and I worked hard to make it so I am quite proud of it. Here is the indiedb page although not updated ever: https://www.indiedb.com/games/fisticuffs-arena 

So then I came to Futuregames. We had four similar game projects but in the span of a year, two in Unity and two in Unreal. The first one was a 2D platformer called Orpheus' Descent where you play as Orpheus and work your way down a dungeon. Here I worked on the Enemy AI. One simple that was moving back and forth between two points. Another one that also moves back and forth but attacks the player if seen. Then a boss that just throw out attacks and doesn't move. https://futuregames.itch.io/orpheus-descent

The next game project was a 3D game called Moon Rock Cafe where you work in a restaurant in space as a host and a waiter at the same time. So you bring the customers to a table, take their order and serve them food. This game I worked on general stuff like implementing stuff and also some UI stuff. https://futuregames.itch.io/moon-rock-cafe

Next thing I want to highlight is a project I made by myself for a school assignment. I was first testing some AI stuff but built on it more for an assignment later on. I thought it would be funny to have chickens shooting each other like a chicken CS game. I first made a scuffed Dust 2 in Unity by memory then put the chickens that first just moved around the map then I gave them rifles (looks like sticks they're holding but I'm not an artist) that shoot eggs when the chickens see another chicken. I wanted kind of a chicken pov thing as well so i put a camera in front of them and you can see their beak and it just looks so good haha. I have it on github here just called "Chicken" if you wanna check it out. Here is a screenshot of pov chicken.
